# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

**Verdix POS** — a Philippine retail point-of-sale system built as a Next.js 16 web app wrapped in Electron 33 for Windows desktop deployment. It has a separate standalone **License Management Server** at `license-server/` that runs independently on port 4100.

## Environment

`.env` at the repo root. Key variables:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `DB_HOST/PORT/USER/PASSWORD/DB_NAME` | Local MySQL (default: `verdix`) |
| `CLOUD_DB_HOST/PORT/USER/PASSWORD/DB_NAME` | Railway MySQL (optional — enables cloud sync) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` | Used by the browser to call API routes |
| `LICENSE_DB_*` | Separate DB for the license server (`verdix_license`) |
| `LICENSE_ADMIN_SECRET` | HMAC secret for license dashboard sessions |
| `LICENSE_UI_PORT` | License server port (default `4100`) |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Optional — AI features |

## Architecture

### Next.js App (port 3000)

**Two route groups under `app/`:**
- `(app)/` — All authenticated pages (dashboard, inventory, sales, purchases, suppliers, customers, reports, POS, settings, approvals, user management)
- `api/` — 150+ REST route handlers. All database logic lives here, not in Server Components.

**Auth pattern** — `POST /api/auth/login` returns `{ uid, displayName, userType, permissions[] }` stored in `localStorage` as `mock-user-session`. Every API route reads it from the request body or headers. POS-type users are hard-redirected to `/pos`.

**No ORM** — raw `mysql2/promise` queries everywhere via `lib/mysql.ts`. Two pools: local (`query()`) and cloud (`cloudQuery()`). The cloud pool is lazily initialized and never blocks the app if Railway is unreachable.

### Database (MySQL 8)

Migrations in `scripts/migrations/` — numbered TypeScript files (001–088+), each with `up()` and `down()`. Run by `npm run migrate`; executed migrations tracked in a `migrations` table.

### Key Domain Patterns

**Stock / Inventory:**
- `lib/batch-deduction.ts` — FIFO cost depletion on every sale. Each product has `inventory_batches` rows; sales pull from oldest batch first.
- `lib/family-sync.ts` — Products can belong to a family (e.g., 1kg bag → 250g sachets). Any stock change recursively syncs all family members.
- `lib/stock-movements.ts` — Every stock change writes a movement record for audit/history.

**Approvals workflow** — A multi-level queue pattern used for purchase orders, stock counts, stock transfers, bad orders, and bulk adjustments. Items are inserted with `status='pending'`, moved through approval levels, then finalized to update actual stock/accounts.

**POS (Point of Sale) — `/pos` route** — Fullscreen checkout UI. The Electron window is the primary deployment target. POS uses its own terminal/shift/cash-drawer management separate from the back-office UI. Checkout hits `POST /api/pos/checkout`.

**Cloud Sync** — Railway direct-MySQL sync. Not event-based: API routes call `cloudQuery()` in parallel after local write. Sync status tracked in `cloud_sync_log`. The `POST /api/cloud-sync/push` and `/pull` endpoints do full-table reconciliation.

**Printing** — ESC/POS via Windows Spooler. `lib/receipt-generator.ts` builds byte buffers using `@point-of-sale/receipt-printer-encoder`. Electron exposes `window.printerBridge` (from `main.js`/`preload.js`) to call the native Windows spooler DLL at `lib/sdk/`. Web builds fall back to `window.navigator.serial` (Web Serial API).

**BIR Compliance (Philippine Tax)** — Sales invoices use BIR-format SI numbers (sequential, never gapped). Z-readings and X-readings are locked reports required for tax filing. `lib/fiscal-utils.ts` handles VAT calculations. These are legally significant — do not change numbering logic without understanding the impact.

### License System (`license-server/`)

A completely standalone HTTP server (no Next.js). Manages Ed25519-signed, machine-bound license keys for the POS.

- **Private key** lives only on this server (`license-server/keys/`, gitignored)
- **Public key** embedded in the POS at `lib/licensing/public-key.ts`
- POS calls `POST /api/license/activate-online` → license server validates product key, checks seat count, signs and returns a machine-bound JWT-like token
- Offline flow: admin generates key from dashboard, gives to customer manually
- `lib/licensing/machine.ts` — Windows hardware fingerprint (registry MachineGuid + WMI serials) used as machine ID in license payloads

### Electron Wrapper

`main.js` is the Electron main process. It spawns the Next.js server as a child process, opens the browser window pointed at `http://localhost:3000`, and exposes the printer bridge via `preload.js`. `printer-sdk.js` and `epson-sdk.js` are Windows-only native bridges using `koffi` FFI.

### E2E Tests

Playwright tests run on port 3100 against a separate `verdix_test` database. `tests/e2e/setup/global-setup.ts` creates and seeds this DB before any test runs. Tests are sequential (workers: 1) to avoid concurrent DB mutations. Run `npm run test:e2e:db` to reset the test DB without re-running tests.

## Important Constraints

- **Windows-only desktop features** — Printer bridge, hardware fingerprinting, Electron packaging. Web browser builds skip these gracefully.
- **MySQL only** — No abstraction layer. All queries are raw SQL.
- **No parallel E2E tests** — The test DB is shared across the test suite; always `workers: 1`.
- **`CLOUD_DB_*` is optional** — If unset, cloud sync is silently skipped. Never throw or crash when cloud is unreachable.
- **BIR SI numbers are legally significant** — The sequential numbering in `sales_invoice_number` must never have gaps or duplicates.
- **License server is a separate process** — It has its own DB (`verdix_license`), its own auth, and runs independently of the Next.js app. It must be started separately with `npm run license:server`.
