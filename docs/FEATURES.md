## 1. Point of Sale (POS)

**Route:** `/pos`  
**Access:** Cashiers (full-screen Electron window) and Admins.

The POS is the primary front-end cashiering terminal. It runs inside an isolated **Electron** window with its own login screen and shift management system, keeping the cashier environment completely separate from the backoffice. All POS data is stored in the central MySQL database, giving backoffice users real-time visibility into sales activity.

> **Why Electron?** Electron allows the POS to operate as a native desktop application, enabling direct USB serial printer communication, offline-capable local operation, and a dedicated full-screen kiosk mode — all on standard Windows hardware.

---

### 1.1 Shift Management

A **shift** is the period during which a cashier takes responsibility for a POS terminal. All transactions, cash movements, and readings are scoped to the active shift.

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Start Shift** | The cashier declares a **starting cash amount** (opening fund) before processing any transaction. This figure seeds the expected cash-in-drawer calculation for the X/Z readings. |
| **End Shift (X-Reading)** | Generates a real-time shift summary (see [1.5 X-Reading & Z-Reading](#15-x-reading--z-reading)) without closing the Z-counter. Useful for mid-day checks without officially ending the working shift. |
| **Shift Takeover** | A new cashier can take over an existing open shift — useful when the original cashier leaves suddenly. Requires **admin PIN authentication** before the handover is recorded. |
| **Cash Transfer** | Mid-shift cash movements: **Pickup** (removing excess cash from the drawer for safekeeping) and **Deposit** (adding petty cash to the drawer). Both types are logged with amount, reason, and timestamp, and are included in the reading totals. |

---

### 1.2 Checkout & Tender

The main checkout screen is the heart of the POS. Items are added to the cart using several input methods:

- **Barcode / SKU Scanning** — Scans product barcodes via USB barcode reader. The system looks up the matching SKU instantly and increments the line quantity if the item is already in the cart.
- **Product Search Dialog** — A fuzzy-search dialog opened when the barcode does not match or when the cashier needs to browse. Products can be filtered by name, SKU, or category. Optionally displays current stock quantities to help cashiers advise customers.
- **Quantity Adjustment** — The cashier can manually increase or decrease the quantity of any line item in the cart using +/− buttons or direct keyboard entry.

#### Payment & Discounts

- **Multi-Payment Tender** — A single transaction can be split across multiple payment methods simultaneously:
  - Cash (change calculation is automatic)
  - Credit / Debit Card
  - GCash
  - PayMaya
  - Check
  - Any custom payment method configured in Settings

- **Loyalty Points Redemption** — When a customer is attached to the transaction, their accumulated loyalty points balance is displayed. The cashier can apply some or all points as a discount (converted using the configured points-to-currency ratio).

- **Senior Citizen / PWD Discount (SC/PWD)** — Applies the statutory **20% discount** as required by Philippine law. The discount is applied at the **line-item level** (not a blanket order discount), and the receipt prints the SC/PWD ID number and computed VAT-exempt amount. Only eligible items are discounted.

- **Custom Line Discount** — A per-item discount (percentage or fixed peso amount) that can be applied individually. Requires optional admin PIN if price-edit auth is enabled.

- **Price-Override (F7)** — Overrides the retail price for a single line item in the current transaction. This change is **not saved** back to the product catalog. Requires admin PIN authentication if configured.

- **Item Description Edit (F1)** — Edits the display name / description of a cart item for the current transaction only. Useful when a product needs a custom label on the receipt (e.g., "Special Order — Custom Frame"). The product name in the catalog is unchanged.

- **Hold Transaction** — Parks the current cart under a named hold slot so the cashier can serve another customer. The held transaction can be recalled at any time. Multiple transactions can be held simultaneously.

- **Customer Selection** — Attaches a customer account to the sale, enabling:
  - Automatic price level application (e.g., wholesale pricing)
  - Loyalty point earning
  - Charge-to-account / credit balance tracking

- **Insufficient Stock Dialog** — When a product's stock falls below the quantity being sold, the system can either **warn** the cashier (they can override and proceed) or **block** the sale entirely. This behavior is controlled by the "Allow Negative Inventory" toggle in POS Setup.

- **Training Mode** — When enabled from POS Setup, all transactions processed in this mode are flagged as training transactions. They are excluded from all official Z-reading totals, reports, and revenue figures. A visible banner appears on-screen to remind the cashier they are in training mode.

---

### 1.3 Receipt & Printing

verdix supports two printing architectures to accommodate different hardware environments:

| Mode | How It Works |
|------|-------------|
| **Browser Print** | Uses the browser's native `window.print()` API with a pre-installed printer driver. Simple to configure, suitable for most setups. |
| **Native DLL (Windows Spooler)** | Uses the `koffi` native module to call the Windows Print Spooler API directly (`winspool.drv`). More reliable for ESC/POS thermal printers that may not expose a standard driver. Configured per terminal. |

**Receipt Features:**

- **Official Receipt / Invoice** — BIR-compliant Official Receipt (OR) with sequential OR number per terminal. Includes business name, address, TIN, VAT breakdown, and the mandatory BIR machine identification fields.
- **ESC/POS Encoding** — Generates raw ESC/POS binary commands for direct thermal printer output. Supports 58 mm and 80 mm thermal paper widths.
- **Print Two Receipts** — Optional: prints a second (duplicate) copy automatically on each tender. Useful for businesses that retain a copy.
- **Credit Slip** — Automatically generated when a charge-to-account sale is processed. The printout serves as the customer's acknowledgment of the credit transaction.

---

### 1.4 Post-Transaction Operations

| Operation | Keyboard Shortcut | Description |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Recent Sales** | `F8` | Browse and reprint any transaction processed during the current shift. Useful for customers who need a duplicate receipt. Optionally requires admin PIN. |
| **Void Transaction** | `F9` | Fully cancels the most recent completed sale. All stock quantities are restored. Requires optional admin PIN. The voided transaction is retained in the database with a VOID status. |
| **Return / Merchandise Credit** | — | Opens the Return Dialog, allowing the cashier to select a previous transaction, choose which items to return, and specify the refund method. A Merchandise Credit receipt is printed. Returns reverse the stock decrement. |
| **Price Inquiry** | `F6` | Look up the current retail price of any product by scanning its barcode or searching by name. Does NOT add the item to the cart — purely informational. |
| **Cancel Sale** | `ESC` | Clears the entire current cart without generating a transaction record. |
| **Line Void** | — | Removes a single item line from the active cart (before tendering). Requires optional admin PIN if configured. |

---

### 1.5 X-Reading & Z-Reading

**X-Reading (Intermediate Shift Report)**

An X-Reading is a **non-destructive** snapshot of the current shift totals. It can be printed at any point during a shift without affecting any counters or closing the shift. Used by managers to monitor sales progress intra-day.

Contents:
- Gross sales, VAT amount, Net sales
- Payment method breakdown
- Total discounts and returns
- Cash-in-drawer reconciliation (opening fund + cash sales − pickups + deposits)

**Z-Reading (Official End-of-Day Closing Report)**

The Z-Reading is the **official daily closing report** per POS terminal. Processing a Z-Reading:

1. Finalizes the shift and increments the **Z-counter** (a running sequential number required by BIR).
2. Locks the shift so no further transactions can be posted to it.
3. Generates a BIR-compliant report including:
   - Gross Sales, VAT Amount, Net Sales, Zero-Rated, VAT-Exempt
   - Discount and return totals
   - Running Grand Total (cumulative since the terminal was first activated)
   - Transaction number range (first OR number to last OR number in the shift)
   - Terminal serial number, MIN (Machine Identification Number), and TIN
4. The report can be printed on thermal paper or saved as a PDF.

---

### 1.6 POS Security

Each of the following sensitive actions can be individually protected by a **secondary admin credential check** (username + password or PIN). This is configured under POS Setup → Authentication Guards:

| Guard | Protects |
|-------|----------|
| **Line Void Auth** | Removing a line item from an active cart |
| **Void / Return Auth** | Voiding a completed sale or processing a return |
| **Recent Sales Auth** | Viewing and reprinting previous transactions |
| **Price Edit Auth** | Overriding an item price (F7) |
| **Edit Item Auth** | Editing an item's name in the cart (F1) |
| **Tax Rates Auth** | Modifying tax rate settings from the POS |
| **Cash Count Auth** | Accessing the end-shift cash counting screen |

When a guard is triggered, a modal dialog appears asking for the authorized user's credentials. The action proceeds only if the credentials are valid and the user has the required role.

---

### 1.7 POS Function Buttons & Keyboard Shortcuts

verdix's POS interface is designed for speed. Every common action has a dedicated **on-screen button** and a corresponding **keyboard shortcut** so cashiers never need to use a mouse. The shortcuts are grouped into three zones:

1. **Header Bar (F-Key Buttons)** — the primary action row at the top of the POS screen
2. **Footer Bar (Ctrl+Key Buttons)** — secondary management actions at the bottom of the POS screen
3. **Cart Navigation Keys** — keyboard keys for moving between line items and adjusting quantities

---

#### Header Bar — F-Key Buttons

These 8 buttons are always visible at the top of the POS screen. Each button shows its icon, label, and keyboard shortcut badge.

| Button | Shortcut | Color | Description | Auth Required? |
|--------|----------|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **Edit Item** | `F1` | Blue | Opens the Edit Item dialog for the currently selected cart line. Allows changing the **item display name** (transaction-level rename — does not affect the product catalog). | No |
| **Line Void** | `F2` | Red | Opens the Cancel Sale dialog to remove the selected line item (partial or full void) or clear all items from the cart. | Optional — if "Line Void Auth" is enabled, prompts for admin credentials first. |
| **Discount** | `F3` | Green | Opens the Discount dialog for the selected cart item. Allows entering a **percentage or fixed discount** for that line, or applying a **global discount to all items** in the cart. | No |
| **Suspend** | `F4` | Orange | **Holds** (parks) the current cart. All items are saved to a hold slot and the cart is cleared, allowing the cashier to start a new transaction immediately. | No |
| **Suspended** | `F5` | Orange | Opens the Held Transactions dialog to **view all parked carts**. The cashier can restore a held cart or delete it. A badge shows the number of currently held transactions. | No |
| **Quantity** | `F6` | Indigo | Opens the Adjust Quantity dialog for the selected cart line. The cashier can type a new quantity directly instead of using +/− buttons. | No |
| **Edit Price** | `F7` | Purple | Overrides the retail price of the selected cart item **for this transaction only**. The price change is not saved to the product catalog. | Optional — if "Price Edit Auth" is enabled, prompts for admin credentials first. |
| **Endorse/Out** | `F8` | Slate | Opens a shutdown/logout confirmation dialog. If a shift is active, the button label shows "Endorse/Out". Confirms before closing the POS session. | No |

---

#### Additional F-Key Shortcuts (Keyboard Only)

These shortcuts do not have dedicated header buttons but are accessible via keyboard at any time:

| Shortcut | Action | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `F9` | **Product Search** | Opens/closes the Product Search dialog. The cashier can search by name, SKU, or category and add items to the cart without scanning. |
| `F10` | **Credit Card Tender** | Opens the Tender dialog pre-set to Credit/Debit Card payment. |
| `F11` | **E-Wallet Tender** | Opens the Tender dialog pre-set to E-Wallet (GCash / PayMaya) payment. |
| `F12` | **Points Tender** | Opens the Tender dialog pre-set to Loyalty Points payment. |
| `Enter` | **Add Item / Tender** | If the barcode/SKU input field has a value → adds the item. If the field is empty → opens the Tender (Cash) dialog. |

---

#### Footer Bar — Ctrl+Key Buttons

These 9 buttons appear at the bottom of the POS cart area. They handle shift management and post-transaction operations:

| Button | Shortcut | Color | Description |
|--------|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Cash Count** | `Ctrl+1` | Green | Opens the End Shift dialog for the **cash counting and shift closure** process. If "Cash Count Auth" is enabled, admin credentials are required first. Calculates opening fund + cash sales + deposits − pickups = expected cash vs. actual count. |
| **Cash Transfer** | `Ctrl+2` | Green | Opens the Cash Transfer dialog to record a mid-shift **Pickup** (remove cash from drawer) or **Deposit** (add cash to drawer). Both are logged and included in X/Z reading totals. |
| **Customer** | `Ctrl+3` | Blue | Opens the Customer Account dialog to **search and attach a customer** to the current transaction. Automatically applies the customer's assigned price level and enables loyalty point earning/redemption. |
| **Loyalty** | `Ctrl+4` | Blue | Opens the Loyalty Rewards dialog showing the **current customer's loyalty point balance** and redemption options. Only available when a non-walk-in customer is selected. |
| **Recent Sales** | `Ctrl+5` | Yellow | Opens the Recent Sales dialog showing all transactions processed **in the current shift**. The cashier can view full details and **reprint** any receipt. Optionally requires admin auth. |
| **Post Void** | `Ctrl+6` | Yellow | Opens the Post Void (Void Sales) dialog to **cancel a previously completed transaction** from the current or a previous shift. Creates a void record while preserving the original; reverses stock. |
| **Merch Credit** | `Ctrl+7` | Yellow | Opens the Return / Merchandise Credit dialog. The cashier selects a previous transaction, chooses which items to return, and records the refund method. Generates a **Merchandise Credit receipt** and restores stock. |
| **Z-READING** | `Ctrl+0` | Purple | Opens the Z-Reading dialog to generate the **official end-of-day closing report** for the selected terminal. Increments the Z-counter. BIR-compliant with VAT breakdown and running totals. |
| **Price Inquiry** | `Ctrl+P` | Purple | Opens the Price Inquiry dialog to **look up the current price of any product** by scanning or searching — without adding it to the cart. Useful for customer price checks at the counter. |

---

#### Cart Navigation & Quick-Edit Keys

When the barcode input field is empty (or not focused), these keys operate on the **currently selected cart line**:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑` (Arrow Up) | Move selection to the **previous line item** in the cart. Wraps around to the last item. |
| `↓` (Arrow Down) | Move selection to the **next line item** in the cart. Wraps around to the first item. |
| `+` | Increment the selected item's quantity by 1. |
| `−` | Decrement the selected item's quantity by 1. If quantity reaches 0, the item is removed from the cart. |

---

#### On-Screen Tender Button

The large **TENDER** button on the right panel (below the totals summary) is the primary checkout trigger. Clicking it opens the Tender dialog defaulting to **Cash** (or the first configured payment method). It is disabled when the cart is empty.

The totals summary panel above the Tender button displays a live breakdown:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Total Amount Due** | Large primary display — net amount after all discounts. |
| **Sub Total** | Net total after item-level discounts. |
| **Vat Sales** | VATable portion of the sale (exclusive of 12% VAT). |
| **Sub Discount** | Total discount amount applied across all items. |
| **Vat Amount** | 12% VAT computed on VATable items. |
| **Amount Due** | Final amount the customer must pay. |
| **Non-VAT Sales** | Revenue from Non-VAT items. |
| **VAT-Exempt Sales** | Revenue from VAT-exempt items. |
| **Zero-Rated Sales** | Revenue from zero-rated items. |
| **No. of Items** | Total quantity of all items in the cart. |

---

## 2. Dashboard

**Route:** `/dashboard`  
**Access:** Admins, Managers (requires `view_dashboard` permission).

The Dashboard is the first screen seen after logging into the backoffice. It provides a real-time, at-a-glance overview of the business's operational health. All data is fetched live on page load and can be refreshed manually.

| Widget | Description | Business Value |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Hourly Sales Chart** | Bar chart showing today's sales revenue broken down by hour (e.g., 8 AM, 9 AM…). | Identify peak and slow hours to optimize staffing. |
| **Monthly Sales Pie Chart** | Donut/pie chart showing the revenue contribution of each product **category** for the current month. | Understand which product lines drive the most revenue. |
| **Sales by Category Chart** | Comparative grouped bar chart across multiple categories for the current period. | Side-by-side category performance comparison. |
| **Top Selling Products** | Ranked list of the highest-revenue products, showing units sold and total revenue. | Fast-moving product visibility for reorder planning. |
| **Supplier Schedule Card** | Displays upcoming expected delivery dates from active suppliers based on configured order schedules. | Proactively prepare for incoming stock. |
| **Low Stock Notification Bell** | Real-time notification badge showing the count of products at or below their reorder points. Clickable to navigate to the Low Stock report. | Prevent stockouts before they happen. |

---

## 3. Products

**Route:** `/products`  
**Access:** Requires `manage_products` permission.

The Products module is the central catalog that defines every item sold in the store. Changes here affect POS pricing, inventory tracking, and purchase order pricing.

---

### 3.1 Product Attributes

Every product in verdix carries the following data fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Name** | Primary display name shown in POS, receipts, and reports. |
| **Description** | Short description visible in product detail views and some receipt formats. |
| **Additional Description** | Extended notes, specifications, or secondary description line. |
| **SKU** | Stock Keeping Unit — unique internal identifier used for inventory tracking. |
| **Barcode** | Scannable barcode (EAN-13, Code 128, etc.). Can differ from SKU. Used by the POS barcode scanner. |
| **Category / Subcategory** | Two-level classification. Used for report grouping, markup hierarchy resolution, and dashboard charts. |
| **Brand** | Product brand. Part of the markup priority hierarchy. |
| **Department** | Organizational grouping used for reporting segments. |
| **Unit of Measure (UOM)** | The base selling unit (e.g., Piece, Box, Kilogram, Liter). Displayed on receipts. |
| **Price (Retail)** | The standard retail selling price shown in the POS. |
| **Cost** | Purchase cost used for margin and profit calculations in reports. Not shown to customers. |
| **VAT Status** | Determines how tax is applied: `VAT` (12% added), `NON-VAT`, `Zero-Rated` (0% VAT on zero-rated exports), `VAT-Exempt` (exempt by law). BIR-compliant tax segregation on receipts. |
| **Reorder Point** | The stock level at which a low-stock alert is triggered and the product appears in the Low Stock Report. |
| **Warehouse Assignment** | Links the product to a physical warehouse location for multi-warehouse environments. |
| **Shelf Location(s)** | One or more shelf assignments within the warehouse. Each shelf can have its own sub-quantity for granular bin-level tracking. |
| **Expiration Date** | Optional expiry date for perishable or time-sensitive products. |
| **Earns Points** | Toggle that controls whether this product contributes loyalty points on POS purchase. Products like alcohol or tobacco can be excluded from earning. |

---

### 3.2 Product Family (Parent–Child Hierarchy)

verdix supports a **three-level product tree** to handle unit-of-measure conversions automatically:

```
Bulk (Parent)
├── Pack (Child)       — e.g., 1 Pack of 6 Pcs
└── Retail (Child)     — e.g., 1 Piece
    └── Variant (Grandchild) — optional further split
```

**How it works:**

- Each child product has a `conversionFactor` (e.g., 1 Box = 24 Pieces, so conversionFactor = 24).
- When stock is received at the **bulk level** (e.g., 10 boxes received via a Purchase Order), the system automatically syncs the equivalent quantity to all child products using the conversion factor.
- Similarly, a stock adjustment on the parent propagates down the tree recursively.
- This eliminates the need to manually update each variant when bulk stock changes.

**Use Case:** Your supplier sells "Coke 1.5L" by the case (24 bottles). You receive at the case level, but you sell individual bottles at the POS. The family hierarchy handles the conversion automatically.

---

### 3.3 Price Levels

Price Levels allow businesses to offer **differentiated pricing** to different customer segments without maintaining separate product catalogs.

Each Price Level defines:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Name** | Label for the tier (e.g., Wholesale, Dealer, Walk-in, VIP). |
| **Base Calculation** | Whether the adjustment is applied to `retail` price or `cost`. |
| **Percentage Adjustment** | The markup or discount percentage relative to the base (e.g., −10% for wholesale). |
| **Minimum Quantity** | Optional: the price level only activates when the cart line quantity meets this threshold. |

Customers are assigned a Price Level in the Customer module. When that customer is selected at the POS, their tier pricing is applied automatically to all eligible items.

---

### 3.4 Supplier Mapping

A single product can be procured from **multiple suppliers** with different costs and terms. Each supplier mapping stores:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Supplier** | The linked supplier record. |
| **Supplier Cost** | The negotiated unit cost from this specific supplier. |
| **Lead Time (days)** | Average days from order to delivery for this supplier. |
| **Reorder Point (ROP)** | Supplier-specific minimum stock threshold before reordering from this supplier. |
| **Primary Supplier Flag** | Marks one supplier as the default for auto-generated purchase suggestions. |

---

### 3.5 Automatic Markup (Suggested Selling Price)

The **Magic Wand (✦)** button, available in both the Purchase Order dialog and the Product edit dialog, automatically calculates a suggested retail price using this formula:

```
Suggested Price = (Cost × (1 + Markup%)) + Shipping Allocation
```

The system resolves the **Markup%** by looking up the following hierarchy in order (first non-zero value wins):

1. **Subcategory markup** — most specific, takes highest priority
2. **Category markup** — one level up from subcategory
3. **Brand markup** — brand-level default
4. **Supplier markup** — the purchasing supplier's default markup
5. **Global default markup** — configured in Settings, lowest priority fallback

The matching is **case-insensitive and whitespace-tolerant** to avoid configuration mismatches.

**Shipping Allocation** distributes the purchase order's shipping cost across items proportionally to their line value (landed cost method).

---

### 3.6 Product Views

| View | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Card View** | Visual tile layout. Each card shows the product image (if any), name, SKU, barcode, current stock badge (color-coded: green = OK, red = low stock), and an action dropdown menu. |
| **Table View** | Compact spreadsheet-style data table with all key fields in columns. Better for scanning through large catalogs quickly. |
| **Low Stock Filter** | One-click filter that instantly narrows the view to only products at or below their configured reorder point, aiding quick replenishment decisions. |

---

## 4. Inventory

**Route:** `/inventory`  
**Access:** Requires `manage_inventory` permission.

The Inventory module tracks the physical quantity of products across all warehouses and shelf locations. It provides tools for manual corrections, physical counts, unit conversions (repackaging), and visual shelf organization.

---

### 4.1 Stock Levels

The main inventory grid displays **real-time stock quantities** for all products. Features:

- **Card / Table View Toggle** — same dual-view options as the Products module.
- **Barcode Search** — quickly locate a product by scanning its barcode.
- **Bulk Adjustment Drawer** — adjust multiple products' stock in a single batch operation.
- **Inline Adjustment** — click a product to open a quick adjustment popup for that specific product.

Stock totals are maintained by the system automatically when:
- A POS sale is completed (stock decrements)
- A Purchase Order is received (stock increments)
- A manual Stock Adjustment is submitted
- A Repackaging operation is processed
- A Return / Merchandise Credit is processed (stock increments)

---

### 4.2 Stock Adjustment

When physical stock does not match the system record, a manual correction can be submitted:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Add / Remove Tab** | Two-tabbed interface: "Add" increments stock; "Remove" decrements it. |
| **Quantity** | The number of units to add or remove. |
| **Reason** | Pre-defined reason codes: Damaged, Expired, Found, Correction, Theft, Miscounted, Other. A custom reason text field is also available. |
| **Projected Impact Preview** | Real-time display showing the **resulting stock level** after the adjustment is applied. Helps prevent accidental over-correction. |

If the `requireAdjustmentConfirmation` setting is enabled, the adjustment is **not applied immediately**. Instead, it is routed to the **Approvals Board** where an authorized user must review and approve it before the stock changes take effect.

---

### 4.3 Stock Counts (Physical Inventory Snapshots)

A Stock Count is a formal **physical inventory reconciliation** process that compares what the system expects versus what was physically counted.

**Full Workflow:**

1. **Create Count** — Staff initiates a new count session. The system records a snapshot of the current expected quantities for all (or selected) products.
2. **Enter Counted Quantities** — Warehouse staff physically counts items and enters the physically-counted quantities per product.
3. **Variance Calculation** — The system computes: `Variance = Counted Quantity − Expected Quantity`. Positive = surplus found; Negative = shortage.
4. **Review Variances** — Staff can review discrepancies before applying.
5. **Apply Count** — Confirms the adjustments. Stock levels are updated to match the physical count.
6. **Approval Gate (Optional)** — If `requireStockCountApproval` is enabled, Step 5 is deferred until an authorized approver signs off on the count.

---

### 4.4 Repackaging (REPACKING)

Repackaging handles the physical conversion of inventory between levels in a **Product Family**. Two directions are supported:

#### Break Pack (Bulk → Retail / Smaller Units)

Used when splitting a bulk quantity into smaller sellable units.

**Workflow:**
1. Select the **parent/bulk product** (e.g., "1 Box of 24 Pcs") and specify the number of boxes to break.
2. System calculates the resulting child quantity: `Child Qty = Boxes × Conversion Factor`.
3. Optionally auto-generate a barcode and calculate a new cost/price for the child units.
4. Submit → Parent stock **decrements**; child stock **increments**.

#### Consolidation (Retail / Pack → Bulk)

The reverse: consolidate smaller units back into bulk packaging.

**Workflow:**
1. Select the **child/pack product** and the quantity to consolidate.
2. System calculates the resulting bulk quantity: `Bulk Qty = Pack Qty ÷ Conversion Factor`.
3. Submit → Child stock **decrements**; parent stock **increments**.

Both operations can be queued for approval if `requireRepackagingConfirmation` is enabled.

---

### 4.5 Shelf Board (Drag-and-Drop Shelf Management)

The Shelf Board is a **Kanban-style visual board** where each column represents a physical shelf location in the warehouse. It provides an intuitive drag-and-drop interface for organizing and reassigning products to shelves.

**Features:**

- **Drag and drop** products between any two shelf columns to reassign them visually.
- **Multi-select:** Hold `Ctrl` and click multiple product cards to select them. Dragging the selection moves all selected products simultaneously.
- **Unassigned Column:** Products not yet assigned to a shelf appear in this column, making it easy to organize new arrivals.
- **Shelf Transfer Approval Gate:** If `requireShelfTransferApproval` is enabled, all drag-and-drop moves are queued for approval before the shelf assignment changes in the database.

---

### 4.6 Transfer Board

A dedicated view for **inter-shelf stock transfers** with explicit per-product quantity control. Unlike the Shelf Board (which reassigns all stock), the Transfer Board lets you move a specific quantity of a product from one shelf to another, creating a granular sub-stock transfer record.

---

### 4.7 Adjustment History

A **paginated log** of all historical stock adjustment entries. Each entry records:

- Date and time of adjustment
- Product name and SKU
- Adjustment type (Add / Remove)
- Quantity changed
- Reason code
- User who performed the adjustment

Useful for auditing unexplained stock discrepancies.

---

### 4.8 Stock Movement Log

The most detailed audit trail in the system. Every single change to a product's stock level — from any source — is recorded here:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Product Name** | The affected product. |
| **Movement Type** | Sale, Purchase Receipt, Adjustment, Return, Transfer, Repackaging. |
| **Quantity Change** | The signed delta (e.g., −3 for a sale of 3 units, +12 for a receipt). |
| **Previous Stock** | Stock level before the movement. |

## 5. Sales

**Route:** `/sales`  
**Access:** Requires `view_sales` permission.

The Sales module aggregates all revenue data from POS transactions, backoffice sales orders, and invoices into a unified view for analysis and management.

---

### 5.1 POS Sales Transactions

A complete list of every POS transaction processed across all terminals.

**Filters available:**
- Date range (single date or range picker)
- Specific cashier / user
- Terminal
- Payment method
- Void status

**Per-transaction actions:**
- **Drill-down** — click any transaction to view the full line-item breakdown, discounts, payment method split, and receipt details.
- **Reprint Receipt** — regenerate and print the original receipt, thermal or PDF.
- **Void Transaction** — cancel the sale (creates a matching void record; original is preserved).

---

### 5.2 Sales by Product / Service

Aggregates all POS sales data **grouped by product**, showing:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Product Name / SKU** | The item sold. |

**Process:**
1. Select the original transaction.
2. Choose which items (and quantities) are being returned.
3. Select the refund method: cash refund, card reversal, or store credit.
4. System generates a **Credit Slip receipt** (printable) and reverses the stock decrement.

The credit is recorded in the customer's account if returned as store credit, reducing their outstanding balance.

---

### 5.7 Post Void

Voids a transaction **after** the shift has ended or on the next business day (when the same-day Void Transaction is no longer available). Requires a documented reason. The original transaction is marked as VOID in the database and excluded from revenue totals.

## 6. Purchases

**Route:** `/purchases`  
**Access:** Requires `manage_purchases` permission.

The Purchases module manages the complete purchase order lifecycle — from creation and sending to suppliers, through receiving goods, through payment. It ties directly into inventory (goods received increment stock) and supplier balances (amounts due increment the supplier's payable balance).

---

### 6.1 Purchase Orders

Purchase Orders (POs) move through the following statuses:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Draft** | The PO has been created but not yet finalized or sent to the supplier. Can be freely edited. |
| **Ordered** | The PO has been submitted/sent to the supplier. Goods are awaited. |
| **Partially Received** | Some but not all ordered lines have been received. Stock was incremented for received items only. |
| **Received** | All lines fully received. Inventory updated. Supplier payable balance increased. |
| **Cancelled** | The PO was voided before receipt. No stock impact. |

**Key Features in Detail:**

#### Add Purchase Order Dialog

A multi-step modal for creating a new PO:
- Select the **supplier** (auto-populates payment terms and due date calculation).
- Enter the **issue date** and **warehouse destination**.
- Add line items: product SKU/name, order quantity, unit cost, line discount (%), and VAT type.
- The **subtotal per line** and **grand total** are calculated live.
- **Suggested Selling Price (Wand ✦)** — per line item, applies the markup hierarchy (see [3.5](#35-automatic-markup-suggested-selling-price)) to suggest a new retail price, which can be saved back to the product catalog.
- **Shipping Cost** — a single shipping charge field. The amount is **distributed proportionally** across all line items by their value (landed cost calculation), affecting each item's effective unit cost.

#### Due Date Auto-Calculation

When a supplier is selected, the system reads the supplier's **payment terms** (e.g., "Net 30", "COD", "Net 15 days") and automatically calculates the **due date** by parsing the term and adding the appropriate number of calendar days to the issue date. The cashier can still manually override the due date.

#### Receive PO Dialog

When goods arrive:
1. Open the Receive PO dialog for the target PO.
2. For each line item, enter the **actually received quantity** (may be less than ordered for partial receipts).
3. System records the receipt, decrements the outstanding ordered quantity, increments product stock, and updates the PO status.
4. If `requireReceivePOConfirmation` is enabled, the receipt is queued for approval before stock is updated.

#### Scheduled Orders

View a calendar or list of upcoming expected delivery dates from all active POs. Helps with receiving bay scheduling.

#### Print / Export

- **Print Purchase Order** — thermal or A4 PDF format with supplier details, line items, and totals.
- **Export to CSV** — full purchase order data for external processing or reporting.

---

### 6.2 Bad Orders

Tracks problems with received goods — items that arrived defective, damaged, expired, or incorrect.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Linked PO** | The purchase order this bad order is associated with. |
| **Product** | The specific product with the issue. |
| **Quantity Affected** | Number of defective units. |
| **Reason** | `Damaged` / `Defective` / `Expired` / `Wrong Item` / `Missing` / `Other`. |
| **Status** | `Reported` → `Return Requested` → `Replaced` / `Credited` / `Resolved`. |
| **Resolution Notes** | Free-form text field for follow-up documentation (e.g., "Supplier agreed to credit next PO"). |

If `requireBadOrderConfirmation` is enabled, bad order submissions are routed through the Approvals Board before becoming official.

---
