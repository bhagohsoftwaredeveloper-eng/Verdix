# Verdix POS — Deployment & Operations Runbook

How to license and cloud-enable Verdix POS for many customers. Covers the
desktop POS, per-customer cloud sync, and the hosted web deployment.

> **Secrets:** every `<...>` below is a placeholder. Never commit real
> passwords or tokens — set them only in `.env` (gitignored) or the Railway
> service **Variables** tab. Treat `LICENSE_KEY`, `CLOUD_CONFIG_SECRET`, and all
> DB passwords as secrets.

## 1. Infrastructure

Two independent Railway projects:

| Project | Contains | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Vendix-LMS** | `vendix-license-server` (deployed) + MySQL `verdix_license` | Issues/validates licenses. POS calls it to activate. |
| **Vendix_Pos** | `Verdix` web service + MySQL (`verdix` + per-customer `verdix_c_*`) | Customer POS data. Web app + tenant databases. |

- Desktop POS calls the license server at `LICENSE_SERVER_URL`
  (`https://vendix-license-server-production.up.railway.app`).
- Each customer's cloud data lives in its **own** database `verdix_c_<id>` on the
  Vendix_Pos MySQL, accessed by a **scoped user** that can touch only that DB.

---

## 2. One-time server setup

### 2a. License server (Vendix-LMS)

Set these on the **Vendix-LMS → vendix-license-server → Variables**:

```
CLOUD_CONFIG_SECRET=<strong random secret — NEVER change once set; back it up>
LICENSE_ADMIN_SECRET=<dashboard session secret>
```

> `CLOUD_CONFIG_SECRET` encrypts every stored cloud-DB password. If it is lost or
> changed, previously stored per-customer configs can no longer be decrypted.

Ensure the license DB schema is up to date (creates `cloud_configs` etc.). With
`LICENSE_DB_*` pointing at the Vendix-LMS MySQL:

```bash
npm run license:migrate
```

### 2b. Provisioning host (your admin machine)

The `cloud:provision` command runs from your machine. It needs the Vendix_Pos
MySQL **admin** credentials (to create tenant DBs + users) and the same
`CLOUD_CONFIG_SECRET` as the server. Requires `mysql` and `mysqldump` on PATH.

```
# Provisioning target = Vendix_Pos MySQL admin (public proxy)
CLOUD_PROVISION_HOST=<vendix_pos-mysql-proxy-host>
CLOUD_PROVISION_PORT=<port>
CLOUD_PROVISION_USER=root
CLOUD_PROVISION_PASSWORD=<vendix_pos root password>
CLOUD_PROVISION_REF_DB=verdix          # reference schema template (keep its schema current)
CLOUD_CONFIG_SECRET=<same value as the license server>

# License DB = Vendix-LMS MySQL (so cloud_configs is written where the server reads it)
LICENSE_DB_HOST=<vendix-lms-mysql-host>
LICENSE_DB_PORT=<port>
LICENSE_DB_USER=root
LICENSE_DB_PASSWORD=<vendix-lms root password>
LICENSE_DB_NAME=verdix_license
```

> **Keep `verdix` (the reference DB) schema current.** It is the template every
> new tenant DB is cloned from (`mysqldump --no-data`). After a schema migration
> to the POS, apply it to `verdix` too, or new customers miss the new tables.

---

## 3. Onboard a new customer (cloud sync)

1. **Create a license** in the license dashboard (`npm run license:server`) →
   issue a Product Key, e.g. `VRDX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX`.

2. **Provision their isolated cloud DB:**
   ```bash
   npm run cloud:provision -- --license VRDX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX
   ```
   Creates `verdix_c_<id>` + a scoped user, loads the schema, stores the
   (encrypted) connection, and adds the `cloud-sync` feature to the license.
   Idempotent; add `--rotate-password` to reset the scoped user's password.

   > To sell a customer **without** cloud sync, simply skip this step — their POS
   > runs offline-only.

3. **Verify isolation** (recommended once): connect as the scoped user and
   confirm it can query its own DB but gets `access denied` on `verdix` or any
   other tenant DB.

---

## 4. Desktop POS install (per store machine)

No cloud credentials in the installer. The POS `.env` needs only:

```
LICENSE_SERVER_URL=https://vendix-license-server-production.up.railway.app
DB_HOST=<local store MySQL>
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=<...>
DB_PASSWORD=<...>
DB_NAME=verdix
```

The customer activates with their **Product Key** (POS activation screen →
Online). On success, the cloud config is delivered and written
(machine-encrypted) to `%PROGRAMDATA%\Verdix\cloud.dat`, and cloud sync starts
automatically — pushing to **their own** tenant DB.

- Licensing is **machine-bound**: the key is locked to that computer's hardware
  fingerprint. A different computer needs its own activation (seat).

---

## 5. Web deployment license (hosted mode)

The deployed web app (Vendix_Pos → **Verdix** service) is a **separate** license
from the desktop, held in an env var — because a container has no stable
hardware fingerprint.

1. **Mint a hosted license:**
   ```bash
   npm run license:new -- --product-key VRDX-WEB-XXXX-XXXX --web --edition web
   ```
   Prints a signed token whose `Machine ID : HOSTED`.

2. **Set it on Railway** → Vendix_Pos → **Verdix** service → Variables:
   ```
   LICENSE_KEY=<the signed token>
   ```

3. **Redeploy.** The activation wall is gone; `/api/license/status` returns
   `active` on any container (the `HOSTED` sentinel skips the hardware check;
   signature/product/expiry are still enforced).

> **`LICENSE_KEY` is a bearer secret.** Anyone who pastes it elsewhere is
> licensed — there is no per-seat enforcement for hosted licenses. **Revocation
> in the LMS is the only kill switch.** Keep it only in Railway Variables.
> Never set `LICENSE_KEY` on a desktop — it shadows the desktop's `license.dat`.

## 5b. Terminal-id uniqueness (multi-writer fiscal isolation)

Per-terminal fiscal records — `shifts`, `cash_transfers`, `x_readings`,
`z_readings`, and the OR/X/Z counters on `pos_terminals` — are pushed to the shared
cloud tagged by `terminal_id`, and are **never pulled back down** (they stay local
to their terminal). Their global uniqueness depends on **each writer having a
distinct `terminal_id`** — the web deployment and every desktop terminal must be
provisioned with a unique terminal id (analogous to the per-deployment
`SI_SERIES_PREFIX`). Colliding terminal ids would collide on push (e.g. the
`z_readings.reading_number` primary key). **Assign each terminal a unique id at
setup.**

---

## 6. Runtime flow (reference)

```
Desktop activate (Product Key)
  → license server validates + returns signed license (+ cloudConfig if feature)
  → POS: license.dat + cloud.dat written → cloud sync → own tenant DB
  → heartbeat re-validates (enforces revoke/renew), refreshes cloud config on change

Web (LICENSE_KEY env)
  → LicenseGate → /api/license/status → reads LICENSE_KEY → sentinel skips hardware
  → licensed; heartbeat sends machineId='HOSTED' → LMS enforces revoke/renew
```

Cloud sync (both): push every 1 min, pull master data every 5 min; no-op when
offline OR when the license lacks the `cloud-sync` feature. Offline-first — the
store keeps operating without internet.

---

## 7. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause / Fix |
|---|---|
| Web shows activation wall | `LICENSE_KEY` not set (or blank) on the Verdix service → set it, redeploy. |
| Web activation `500` | `CLOUD_CONFIG_SECRET` missing on the license server (degrades to no cloud config, but check it is set). |
| `cloud:provision` skips a table on Railway | The `verdix` reference DB is missing that table — update the reference schema. |
| Customer's data not syncing | License lacks the `cloud-sync` feature (didn't run `cloud:provision`), or no internet, or `cloud.dat` missing (re-activate). |
| Scoped user can read another customer's DB | Provisioning bug — re-run `cloud:provision`; verify `GRANT` is scoped to `verdix_c_<id>.*` only. |
| Desktop stuck on "wrong computer" | Key was issued for a different machine — re-issue for this machine's Machine ID. |
| Revoked customer still working | Revocation applies on the next heartbeat; ensure the machine has reached the license server since revocation. |
